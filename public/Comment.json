Structure:
/src
    CommentApp.js
    CommentInput.js
    CommentList.js
    Comment.js

When referencing subscriptions.js from AWS Amplify, there are Comment attribute to discuss:
1. it may also include commentId,  courseId, createdAt,  nextToken(instead of lists)
2. may change attribute name:  Comment.comment -> Comment.context

Note:
1. "CommentList" will have a another attribute: `courseId`, which should be completed later together with Course.js
    i.e. Course.js should have an export attribute that could provide current courseId
2. `Username` should  be completed later together with user authentication(user login)
    i.e. Login function should have an export attribute that could provide current userName/userId
